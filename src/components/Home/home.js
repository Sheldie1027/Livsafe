                        <h4>Warm baths:</h4> You can reduce a childâ€™s fever by giving them a warm sponge bath. 
                        Warm baths can also reduce cold and flu symptoms in adults. 
                        Adding Epsom salt and baking soda to the water can reduce body aches.
                        Adding a few drops of essential oil, such as tea tree, juniper, rosemary, thyme, orange, lavender, or eucalyptus, may also have a soothing effect.

                        <h4>Ginger:</h4>A few slices of raw ginger root in boiling water may help soothe a cough or sore throat. 
                        Research suggests that it can also ward off the feelings of nausea that so often accompany influenza.

                        <div className="space"/>

                        <h4>Honey:</h4>Drinking honey in tea with lemon can ease sore throat pain. 
                            Research suggests that honey is an effective cough suppressant, too.

                        <h4>Salt water:</h4>Gargling with salt water reduces and loosens mucus, which contains bacteria and allergens.
                         To try this remedy at home, dissolve 1 teaspoon of salt in a full glass of water.
                          Swish it around your mouth and throat. Then spit it out.
